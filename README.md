Marikc0's Optionals (Working Title)
===========

The current concept is on-going. I'm not really sure what the main purpose of the mod is yet. It's a learning process for me. The mod is going to have some comical assets (which is why manure begins as an edible item). I believe that if an object can fit in your mouth you should be able to eat it, regardless of how sane you are for doing so. If I could turn Gold Ingots into food, I would and you would get a broken tooth in your inventory for doing so. Likely there will be a lot of rare drops in the mod. Right now I'm just doing what I'm able to do. I'm not taking this entirely serious, but it should be at least somewhat interesting anyway. Also, a lot of the mod is going to be configurable. A whole lot. I want players to have the option of customizing the mod however they want, within certain limits (and disabling any features that they don't want).
