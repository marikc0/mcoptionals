Marikc0's Optionals (Working Title)
===========

The current concept is on-going. I'm not really sure what the main purpose of the mod is yet. It's a learning process for me. The mod is going to have some comical assets (which is why manure begins as an edible item) and some realistic aspects. Likely there will be a lot of rare drops in the mod. The mod will have lots of config options. I want players to have the option of customizing the mod however they want. Will it release? Who knows. I have no intention to make the greatest mod out there. This is simply how I am passing my time.

DETAILED INFORMATION
--------------------
- Anthracite Coal: Basically, it burns better than any existing coal that you've likely seen in other mods. Also exceeding RailCraft coke by a little bit. The difference is that by default the coal is a rare find (about 2% spawn rate). You can turn it into a compressed coal block. From there, you will be able to compress it with IC2 and receive a diamond.
- Rice Crop: Plant with one rice seed. Upon full growth you will receive between 2-3 seeds. The seeds themselves are rice. You create other items using the seeds (such as sushi). You will find the seeds in dungeon chests (and possibly as a drop from grass, assuming that the drop rate can be low enough to satisfy me).

ORIGINAL IDEAS (That I don't have the skill for)
- Forestry apiary glasses (be able to see what is in an apiary and see items/bees as they move to output, etc)
- Leather skinning, drying, etc system.
